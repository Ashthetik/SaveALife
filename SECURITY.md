# **GitHub Repository Security Policy**

---

## Our Police

1. **Purpose**
The purpose of this security policy is to establish guidelines and best practices for ensuring the security and integrity of the GitHub repository. By adhering to this policy, we aim to protect sensitive information, prevent unauthorized access, and mitigate potential security risks.

2. **Access Control**
2.1. **Ownership**: The repository must have designated owners responsible for managing access, maintaining security, and approving changes.
2.2. **Access Levels**: Access to the repository should be granted based on the principle of least privilege. Each user should be assigned the appropriate access level required for their role, and access should be regularly reviewed to ensure it aligns with the current needs.
2.3. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Enable 2FA for all user accounts accessing the repository to add an extra layer of security and prevent unauthorized access.

3. **Repository Configuration**
3.1. **Branch Protection**: Enable branch protection rules to prevent direct pushes to important branches, enforce code reviews, and require passing checks before merging.
3.2. **Branch Naming Convention**: Establish a consistent branch naming convention to easily identify the purpose and scope of each branch.
3.3. **Default Branch**: Set the default branch to a stable and well-tested branch, ensuring that sensitive or unstable code is not inadvertently exposed.
3.4. **Dependency Management**: Regularly review and update dependencies to address any known security vulnerabilities. Utilize automated tools and security advisories to assist in this process.

4. **Code Review**
4.1. **Pull Requests**: All changes to the repository should be submitted as pull requests. Pull requests must undergo code review by one or more assigned reviewers before being merged.
4.2. **Reviewer Selection**: Select reviewers who possess the necessary expertise and familiarity with the codebase to conduct a thorough review.
4.3. **Security Review**: Consider involving a designated security reviewer for pull requests that involve security-critical changes or affect sensitive functionality.
4.4. **Secure Coding Practices**: Encourage developers to follow secure coding practices, such as input validation, output encoding, and avoiding common security pitfalls (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).

5. **Sensitive Information Handling**
5.1. **Encryption**: Sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords, tokens) should never be committed directly to the repository. Utilize a secure and reliable key management system or encrypted configuration files.
5.2. **Environment Variables**: Store sensitive configuration values as environment variables rather than hardcoding them in the codebase.
5.3. **Secrets Management**: Leverage GitHub's built-in Secrets Management or an external secure secrets management solution to securely store and manage sensitive information required for CI/CD pipelines or other automated processes.

6. **Security Monitoring**
6.1. **Security Alerts**: Enable security alerts on the repository to receive notifications about known vulnerabilities in the dependencies.
6.2. **Security Incident Response**: Establish procedures and roles for responding to security incidents. Designate a point of contact and define escalation paths in case of a security breach or vulnerability discovery.
6.3. **Logging and Auditing**: Enable logging and monitoring capabilities to track repository activities, including code changes, access attempts, and administrative actions. Regularly review and analyze the logs to identify and investigate any suspicious activities.

7. **Reporting Security Issues**
7.1. **Responsible Disclosure**: Encourage researchers and users to responsibly disclose any security vulnerabilities or concerns they discover in the repository.
7.2. **Contact Information**: Provide a dedicated contact point or process for reporting security issues. Clearly communicate how security vulnerabilities should be reported and the expected response time for addressing them.

8. **Training and Awareness**
8.1. **Security Education**: Conduct regular security awareness training for repository contributors to promote good security practices and keep them informed about emerging threats and vulnerabilities.
8.2. **Documentation**: Maintain up-to-date documentation outlining the security policy, guidelines, and best practices related to the repository. Make it easily accessible to all repository contributors.

9. **Policy Review**
Regularly review and update this security policy as necessary to adapt to changing security requirements and incorporate lessons learned from security incidents or best practices.

By following this security policy, we can ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our GitHub repository and minimize the risk of security breaches.
